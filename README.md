# Current-Projects
Throughout my final semester at Colorado State University I am working on multiple projects. Last updated on 1/27/2026.

**1. CSU Men's Basketball Lineup Analysis**
* Working alongside a professor, graduate student, and a team of undergraduate students to assist the men's basketball analytics coach with lineup analysis.
* My personal analysis has involved one hot encoding online data to perform ridge regression and determine players with optimal turnover stats.
* Further plans to analyze these turnover stats and determine pairs of players that can help defensive performance.
* Potentially involve skill curves and other stats to ultimately create an interactive Shiny App to assist coaching.

**2. Capstone: Forecast Housing Prices**
* Plans to use public Zillow and US Census data to predict housing prices based on various metrics.
* Multiple models will be used and incorporated to a final Power BI dashboard.

**3. Honors Thesis: Overtourism and Livability - Rome as a Case Study**
* Utilize public data such as ISTAT, Eurostat, and other online sources to determine the impact of tourism on Rome.
* Plans to potentially integrate other major European tourist cities into the study.
* After model creation, results will be integrated into a Power BI dashboard that allows users to analyze the effect of increased tourism on prominent European cities.
