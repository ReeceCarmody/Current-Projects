Throughout my final semester at Colorado State University I am working on multiple projects.

*Last updated on 2/19/2026.*
* Working alongside a professor, graduate student, and a team of undergraduate students to assist the men's basketball analytics coach with lineup analysis.
* My personal analysis has involved one hot encoding online data to perform ridge regression and determine players with optimal turnover stats.
* Manually created skill curves to analyze how player's True Shooting Percentage changes with more Usage.
* Found results from the skill curves that encourage/discourage playtime for various players.

* Data cleaning was performed to remove repitive features, rename columns, filter features, create new variables, and remove NA values.
* Initial exploratory analysis - such as correlation plots and feature importance through LASSO & SHAP - is being developed.
* Plans for multiple models to be used and incorporated to a final Power BI dashboard.

**3. Honors Thesis: Overtourism and Livability - Rome as a Case Study**

* Utilize public data such as ISTAT, Eurostat, and other online sources to determine the impact of tourism on Rome.
